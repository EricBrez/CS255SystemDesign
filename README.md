Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  DriverPass is a new company seeking to provide training for new drivers as well as practice to take their driving tests to get their liscences. DriverPass is requesting a system that can handle the scheduling of appointments, provide the learning material to the students, as well as track their progress with the practice tests and instructor notes.
  
What did you do particularly well?
  The entire process was a learning experience, I think my diagramming is the thing I did the best. I believe that I was able to create several pieces of a comprehensive map of the proposed system.
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  One thing that I struggled with and could improve is determining the requirements. I believe I got the non-functional and functional requirements down, but I struggled with the technical requirements and the specifics that I needed to aquire for the project.
  

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  For a system to be succesful it requires more than just the system requirements. A system with all the required functionality that is not user friendly is not going to help anyone. An intuitive system that is easy to use that has a logical flows and high usability has taken the user into account. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
  My approach to designing software involves looking at the overall goal and then programming from where I want the application to start, and then building off of that until all the application functionality is there. I try to implement each function carefully.
